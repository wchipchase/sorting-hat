Sorting Hat
Instructions
You are in charge of bringing the Hogwarts sorting hat to life!

To start off with, you will use a bootstrap jumbotron to have your sorting hat introduce itself and start the sorting process (by clicking on a button). A bootstrap form will then appear to fill in the student's name and a button to sort. This should then assign the student to a random house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin). On sorting a student, the form should clear and a bootstrap card with the student's name and house should print below the form. You should also be able to expel a student after they have been sorted, which should remove their card from the student record.

In the end, your app will look something like: Sorting Hat Mockup

Technical Requirements
You must use Boostrap 4 to style your page components.
You should apply responsive design to your page (aka your app should be designed to work on small screens)
Your JS file should be comprised of functions, no actions should happen in your code outside of a function
Your HTML and JS should all have proper indentations
Planning Requrements
Create a github project for this assignment.
You should make cards/tickets based on deliverable features, i.e. sorting hat jumbotron with get started button, click event to show form, sorting event to clear form and print student, expel student event.
Optional Bonus
Helpful Form: An error message shows if a user tries to sort a student without filling out the form.
House Colors: The color of the student's card changes depending on which house they were sorted.
Card Ordering: Sort the student cards by some criteria (i.e. alphabetically by name, by house)
Voldermort's Army: Create a separate container of cards that hold the cards for students that have been expelled. These should be styled differently from Hogwarts students.
